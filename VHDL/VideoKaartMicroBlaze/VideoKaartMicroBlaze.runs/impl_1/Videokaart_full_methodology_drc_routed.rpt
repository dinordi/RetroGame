A primary clock z2/PmodIPs_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin z2/PmodIPs_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell z2/PmodIPs_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) z2/PmodIPs_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on uartrx relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of z2/PmodIPs_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on uarttx relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of z2/PmodIPs_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1.
Related violations: <none>
